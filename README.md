# superslew
Slew/ground control plugin for X-Plane 10

- Move your plane around. Joystick moves forwards/backwards or sideways, throttle
controls speed. The yaw control rotates the plane.

- The plane is kept on the ground, even across hills, but be careful
  if you end up partly in the ground; you will "crash" when you disable
  the SuperSlew mode.

- If you enable altitude mode, joystick right/left moves plane
up/down. You can not go below your starting altitude.

- There are three speeds to choose from.

- Shows a dialog box in the lower right corner when enabled, showing
the joystick input values, altitude, and geographical position.

- You may need to move your controls a bit before enabling SuperSlew.

- It may not parse your joysticks properly if you have had different
  controls connected at different times. X-Plane seems to leave traces
  in the configuration files confusing SuperSlew. The only cure is to
  throw away your preferences and configure them again.

- Only tested with a simple Saitek joystick and CH Products pedals.
